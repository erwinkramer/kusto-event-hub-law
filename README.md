# kusto-event-hub-law

Log Analytics Workspace export to Event Hub to Kusto Cluster (Azure Data Explorer).

*The code is the documentation :)*

Some bits were from: https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/blob/master/quickstarts/microsoft.kusto/kusto-event-hub/main.bicep, but i took the cheapest SKUs and the simplest testable setup, batteries included.

Please see last comment on [script.kql](/bicep/script.kql) for the real work.
